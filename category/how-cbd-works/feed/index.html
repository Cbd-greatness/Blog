<p>With all the attention CBD has been getting, it’s easy to find information on all its benefits — but is there a downside? <em>Does CBD have any side effects?</em></p>



<p>To create this article, we looked at both scientific research and anecdotal reports from CBD users. From our in-depth research, what we found suggests that the side effects of CBD oil are usually minor, and, for most people, the benefits far outweigh the rare reports of discomfort.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.optimizepc.org/expressuninstaller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cbd-for-pets-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-186" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cbd-for-pets-2.jpg 750w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cbd-for-pets-2-300x133.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><figcaption>D<em>oes CBD oil have side effects? If so, what are they?</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>The War on Drugs Hurts Cannabis &amp; Hemp Research</h3>



<p>Due to the the stigma associated with the war on drugs, free and open research into both hemp and its close relative, psychoactive cannabis, is only just beginning in many ways.</p>



<p>For example, the first study into the benefits of <a href="http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/marijuana-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cannabis in veterans</a>
 with otherwise untreatable post-traumatic stress disorder is beginning 
in 2017, but only after the researchers involved struggled through years
 of red tape and put their careers at risk in order to do promote the 
need for this vital research. Fortunately, their work, and that of 
others like them, have begun to peel back the bureaucracy preventing 
scientific research.</p>



<p>On the hemp side of the equation, the 2014 Farm Bill which legalized 
the growth and sales of agricultural hemp in the U.S., and the 
production of its derivatives like CBD oil, should help to open the way 
for research into the benefits and possibilities of hemp in all its 
forms. While we’ll summarize some of what we’ve found from our research 
into CBD side effects below, we expect to see a lot more research in 
this field in the years to come.</p>



<h3>CBD Oil Studies Find Few Side Effects</h3>



<p>Although <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="3" data-gr-id="3">the medical</g> research is still in its preliminary stages,  scientists have devoted considerable effort to <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">proving</g> that CBD oil <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">is  safe</g> for human and animal consumption.</p>



<p>A <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00207458608985678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>
 published in 1986 in the International Journal of Neuroscience, 
examined the effects of CBD oil in 5 patients with dystonic movement 
disorders (muscle tremors and other forms of uncontrollable movements). 
CBD oil’s side effects “were mild and included hypotension [low blood 
pressure], dry mouth, psychomotor slowing [slowed thoughts or 
movements], lightheadedness, and sedation,” according to the study’s 
authors, Paul Consroe, Reuven Sandyk and Stuart R. Snider.</p>



<p>According to this study, CBD seemed to help people with their 
dystonia, but might have made some symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease 
(found in 2 of the study’s subjects) a little bit worse. However, other,
 more recent research has found that CBD can <a href="http://www.medicalmarijuanainc.com/parkinsons-disease-medical-marijuana-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefit Parkinson’s patients</a>.</p>



<p>One study of 8 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with epilepsy, <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/137430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>
 in 1980 in Pharmacology, looked at the side-effects of CBD when 
consumed daily for a month. “All patients and volunteers tolerated CBD 
very well and no signs of toxicity or serious side effects were detected
 on examination,” wrote the researchers, who also found that CBD can 
help some people with epilepsy.</p>



<h3>Consuming higher dosage of CBD caused no toxicity</h3>



<p>In 2006, a group of researchers studying the potential benefits of  CBD in treating psychosis and <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="4" data-gr-id="4">anxiety,</g> looked at several studies of CBD  oil’s safety and summarized their findings in a paper published by the  Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research. Noting that CBD  safety was first proven through animal research, the scientists added:<br></p>



<p>“Acute CBD administration by the oral, inhalatory or intravenous 
route did not induce any significant toxic effect in humans. In 
addition, chronic administration of CBD for 30 days to healthy 
volunteers, at daily doses ranging from 10 to 400 mg, failed to induce 
any significant alteration in neurological, psychiatric or clinical 
exams. Finally, in patients suffering from Huntington’s disease, daily 
doses of CBD (700 mg) for 6 weeks did not induce any toxicity. 
Therefore, confirming results from animal studies, the available clinical data suggest that CBD can be safely administered over a wide dose range.“</p>



<p>A 2007 study published in Phytomedicine found that CBD, along with other similar substances including THC (the main active ingredient in psychoactive cannabis), has potential as an anticoagulant, so people with who have diseases like hemophilia that cause problems with blood clotting should use extra caution with these substances.</p>



<h3>An Anecdotal look at CBD Oil side effects show quality matters</h3>



<p>Of course, since many of these studies have small sample sizes, and  every person reacts a little bit differently to any substance, we looked  at CBD oil users’ anecdotal reports, posted on popular online  communities and forums, such as Reddit and sites that sell CBD products.</p>



<p>A handful of very sensitive people who use CBD oil report feeling a mild mood and mind-altering effects, similar to a low dose of psychoactive cannabis, but these effects appear to be rare. Some people also reported mild digestive upset, including diarrhea, from ingesting  CBD oil.</p>



<p>According to one <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CBD/comments/4bnoes/does_anyone_else_get_headaches_from_cbd_oil/" target="_blank">post</a> on Reddit, some people get headaches from using CBD oil, which is a bit unusual since CBD can also sometimes be used to treat migraines. However, other Redditors have suggested the problem was actually the purity of the CBD extract.</p>



<p>“I have just recently started taking CBD for headaches, and after three weeks of getting worse headaches, I finally figured out that my  CBD oil was cheap crap — and that a LOT of it is,” a Redditor named  Pellquin wrote last year.</p>



<h4>When it comes to CBD, Purity &amp; Source Matters</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-188" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1.jpg 1000w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1-300x135.jpg 300w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1-768x346.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p><g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">Pellquin</g> had it right: unfortunately, there’s a lot of poor quality  CBD oil from unreliable brands. The CBD oil market is still in its infancy, and it can be challenging for consumers to educate themselves except through expensive trial and error. </p>



<p>CBD oil is a poorly regulated market and most products are imported  from overseas. Since hemp absorbs chemicals from the ground, including  lead and mercury, growing conditions can make a big difference.  Labelling of CBD products is also often inconsistent and unclear, making  it confusing for CBD consumers to know what they’re buying.</p>



<p>Three pieces of advice for buying CBD oil:</p>



<ul><li><em>Always ask for third party lab results when buying CBD oil</em></li><li><em>Pay close attention to product labeling</em></li><li><em>Don’t hesitate to ask a more knowledgeable expert for help.</em></li></ul>



<h4>CBD is Safe, But Research Before You Buy &amp; Use</h4>



<p>Overall, we found that scientists and doctors consider CBD oil to be 
safe for most people to use, and there are few, if any, serious side 
effects.</p>



<p>While everyone has their own unique body chemistry, it seems like the
 vast majority of people can ingest CBD oil without ever feeling any 
unpleasant side effects at all, and the remaining few will mostly likely
 experience only minor symptoms like stomach upset or dry mouth. Since 
scientists are using pure extracts from known sources, it’s likely that 
some consumer reports of headaches or other minor adverse reactions 
could be due to impurities in inferior CBD products.</p>



<p>As always, you should closely research the products you buy, and 
consult with a medical expert if you have any doubt about the best or 
safest way to use CBD oil.</p>

<p>Imagine you have an important message to convey to another person, a 
message with crucial details. The person waiting for your message is 
responsible for relaying this vital information so each member of their 
team can make appropriate adjustments to their assigned task. Now 
imagine what could happen if your message never made it to your intended
 recipient.</p>



<p>This same type of communication breakdown can happen 
in your body. Nearly every essential function necessary for your 
survival is regulated by an elaborate system of messengers and 
receptors, your Endocannabinoid System (ECS). To understand the health 
and wellness potential of CBD, it’s helpful to understand the role of 
your ECS receptors and how they function within this system.</p>



<h2><strong>What Are CBD Receptors?</strong></h2>



<p>The
 receptors often referred to as CBD receptors, are technically known as 
cannabinoid receptors. These essential G-protein receptors are located 
on the surface of cells throughout your body, from your brain to your 
nerve endings. Your cannabinoid receptors receive information from your 
Endocannabinoid System messengers and use this information to initiate 
an appropriate response. Since cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid, a 
lipid that functions as a neurotransmitter, it interacts with the 
receptors of your Endocannabinoid System.</p>



<h2><strong>What is the Endocannabinoid System (ECS)?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Your Endocannabinoid System  is the largest system of neurotransmitters and receptors in your body.  It’s your ECS that modulates your brain function, organ function, and  keeps essential endocrine processes functioning efficiently. Your ECS is  instrumental to so many important functions that many researchers today  believe it is responsible for homeostasis, the processes that restore  balance when functions in your body are disrupted by internal or  external forces.<sup>1</sup></p>



<h3><strong>Regulating Bodily Functions</strong></h3>



<p>The
 response initiated by your endocannabinoid receptors is dependent on 
the chemical composition of the message it receives. The interaction 
between the messenger and receptor will determine the appropriate 
response, and excitatory response, inhibitory response, or secondary 
message to other regulatory systems. Just a few of the many processes 
regulated by the functions of your Endocannabinoid System include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sleep Regulation</strong> Your sleep cycles are regulated by circadian rhythms, the 24-hour internal clock that regulates numerous essential functions.<sup>2</sup>  While your circadian rhythms are regulated by your exposure to light  and darkness; it’s the function of your Endocannabinoid System that  regulates your circadian rhythms and stabilizes sleep cycles, as well as  numerous processes that can interfere with restful sleep.<sup>3</sup></li><li><strong>Metabolism and Appetite </strong>Your metabolism, also regulated by the ECS, is determined by the <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">complex  interaction</g> of your gastrointestinal system, liver, muscle, and <g class="gr_ gr_41 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="41" data-gr-id="41">fat  storage</g>. The activation of CBD receptors modulates nutrient processing,  appetite regulation, fat distribution, and metabolic pathways.<sup>4</sup></li><li><strong>Moods and Emotions </strong><g class="gr_ gr_42 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="42" data-gr-id="42">The  endocannabinoid</g> receptors in your amygdala regulate emotional <g class="gr_ gr_43 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="43" data-gr-id="43">responses  and</g> memories. The role of the ECS and our emotions has been <g class="gr_ gr_44 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="44" data-gr-id="44">clearly  established</g>, affecting our feelings of happiness as strongly <g class="gr_ gr_45 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="45" data-gr-id="45">as  depression</g> or anxiety. The endocannabinoid receptors in the emotional  centers of your brain influence the release of serotonin, dopamine and  other neurotransmitters that have a direct impact on your mood.<sup>5</sup></li><li><strong>Immune System Function </strong>Your  Endocannabinoid System is believed to be the driving force of <g class="gr_ gr_46 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="46" data-gr-id="46">your  immune</g> system. The organs and cells of your immune system, <g class="gr_ gr_47 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="47" data-gr-id="47">including  your</g> mast cells, T-cells, tonsils, and lymphocytes are rich <g class="gr_ gr_48 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="48" data-gr-id="48">with  endocannabinoid</g> receptors.

<h2><strong>The Two CBD Receptors</strong></h2>



<p>It’s  the interaction between messengers and receptors that keeps your  Endocannabinoid System working efficiently and effectively. There are  two different types of endocannabinoid receptors in your body. They are  easy to remember, CB1 and CB2. While both receptors are found throughout  your body, they are found in different concentrations within specific areas. For example:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CB1 Receptors</strong> CB1  receptors are found most abundantly in your central nervous system,  your brain, and the spinal cord. The location of the receptor will influence its basic function. While the CB1 receptors in your amygdala regulate your emotional responses and memory, the CB1 receptors in your hypothalamus help regulate your metabolic processes.</li><li><strong>CB2 Receptors</strong><g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="14" data-gr-id="14"> </g>The  receptors found most abundantly in your peripheral nervous system <g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="15" data-gr-id="15">are  your</g> CB2 receptors. Your peripheral nervous system extends from <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">your  spinal</g> column to your organs, muscles, and other areas of your body. CB2  receptors are intricately involved in immune system function <g class="gr_ gr_17 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="17" data-gr-id="17">and  inflammatory</g> responses.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>How CBD Receptors Respond to CBD Intake</strong></h2>



<p>Soon
 after the discovery of your endocannabinoid receptors, researchers 
discovered that our bodies manufacture cannabinoids. The two main 
cannabinoids made in your body (anandamide and 2-AG) are called 
endocannabinoids. In a perfect world, your body would make all the 
endocannabinoids needed to interact with the endocannabinoid receptors. 
But it does not always work that way. When there are not enough 
messengers to interact with the cannabinoid receptors, the message is 
lost.</p>



<p>CBD mimics the effects of the cannabinoids created in your body and interacts with the endocannabinoid and several non-endocannabinoid receptors.  When you take hemp-derived CBD, the cannabinoids circulate through your body until they find a receptor they can connect with, attaching to neurons. Since so many essential functions are dependent on the messengers and receptors of your ECS, the effects are dependent on the system influenced.</p>
