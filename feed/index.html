</p>
<p>CBD for pets is now legal almost everywhere. It’s available as<br />treats, capsules and most commonly sold as an oil, designed to be<br />sprinkled over pets’ food before eating.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>Pet-related CBD products make up a significant portion of the over $6 billion cannabis industry, and that number is only growing. Over 92% of veterinarians say they’ve been asked by their clients about using CBD for their pets.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>Let’s get everything out on the table on what you need to know about<br />CBD, whether it’s a good option for your pet, and most importantly, how<br />to talk to your veterinarian about it.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<h3><strong>What is CBD?</strong></h3>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>CBD stands for cannabidiol. Cannabidiol is a compound that can be extracted from cannabis, the plant that produces both marijuana and hemp. Cannabinoids like CBD interact with the endocannabinoid receptors located in the central and peripheral nervous systems.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>CBD is typically made into an oil. Sometimes the oil is sold as a tincture and in other cases it’s used to produce standalone products such as foodstuffs, drinks, or even chewing gum. CBD use among both humans and domesticated animals is on the rise.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>It’s important to note that CBD does <em>not </em>contain THC, the other<br />primary compound found in cannabis. This is important because THC is<br />what produces the “high” typically associated with marijuana. Pure CBD<br />does not produce any psychoactive effects whatsoever.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What should you ask your vet about CBD?</strong></h3>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>You should never, ever give your pet CBD without talking to your veterinarian first.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>Did you know that California is the only state in which <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB2215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s legal</a><br />for veterinarians to bring up CBD with their clients? Even in CA, vets<br />can’t legally dispense CBD products. In all other states, pet owners<br />looking for more information should bring the issue up themselves,<br />listening closely to their vet’s advice.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>If your vet can’t actually dispense CBD, what should you ask her? Good<br />questions might include the type of CBD she suggests, the correct<br />dosages, and the dosing schedule. You should also ask her how to store<br />the CBD and how to tell if it’s working. Most importantly, you should<br />ask her what signs to look for that would indicate you should <em>stop </em>giving your pet the compound.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<h3><strong>What should you look for when buying CBD?</strong></h3>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>It’s important to be very careful about what you buy when searching for CBD. The industry is highly unregulated and it’s <em>not </em>a product you should skimp on. Pay more for quality assurance.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>You can buy CBD online, in a store, or even at a dispensary. Products that claim to follow Good Manufacturing Practices or that have a seal from the National Animal Supplement Council (NASC) are good places to start. These certifications mean the product has been made with safe ingredients in a clean environment. The gold standard for CBD products are those that have had an independent third-party test done and can provide a Certificate of Analysis (COA.)</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>Don’t give your pet CBD products that are intended for humans. These could have other ingredients such as grapeseed oil or xylitol that could be toxic to animals.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<figure><a href="http://www.optimizepc.org/antimalwarepro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/HEMP_CBD_DOG_Health-509x340.jpg" alt="" /></a></figure>

<p></p>


</p>
<h4><a href="http://click our website greatness">http://ourwebsitelink.com</a>`</h4>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<h3><strong>When should you stop giving your pet CBD?</strong></h3>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>If you notice any signs of distress from your pet, stop giving the CBD immediately and take your pet to an emergency veterinary clinic if you have any reason to think the issue is dire.</p>
<p>


<p></p>
<p></p>


</p>
<p>After you start giving CBD, watch for drug interactions with any other medications your pet may be taking. Side effects you might expect to see include dry mouth, lowered blood pressure, or drowsiness. If any of these side effects seem to be serious or affecting your pet’s overall quality of life, talk to your vet as soon as possible.</p>
<p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dog parents want to keep their pups as healthy and happy as any other member of the family. We spend hundreds to thousands per year on vet bills, specialty food and whatever else they need so they can live their best lives too.</p>



<p>Part of keeping your pets happy and healthy is to evaluate the treatment  options available when your pet is suffering. Just like in the human  healthcare world, overprescribing expensive, sometimes dangerous  pharmaceuticals has become a serious issue in veterinary care. Even the FDA acknowledges that  adverse reactions and medication errors are a problem in veterinary  medicine, and can even pose risk to the human members of your family as  well.</p>



<p>Veterinary prescriptions can be both risky and costly. Some dog parents are fortunate to have pet insurance to help handle some of those costs. But, even with that financial assistance, pet parents still don’t get the peace of mind knowing that the pills are doing any good or at the very least not causing further problems.</p>



<p>Many of us have switched to naturopathy to treat an array of common 
ailments, to avoid the cost and unknown side effects of prescription 
drugs. Arnica for aches, turmeric to fight inflammation, ginger for 
indigestion–these are just a few examples of tried and true natural 
remedies for some of the more prevalent health issues, which are also 
common in pets.</p>



<p>You may have heard the buzz around CBD oil as an alternative to prescription drugs to treat a variety of health issues in humans, but did you know your furry friend can benefit from CBD oil in many of the same ways? CBD oil extracted from the hemp plant contains compounds that support the immune, nervous and endocannabinoid systems in the body. You can learn more about the endocannabinoid system and how CBD oil works at <a href="/how-cbd-works">/how-cbd-works</a>.</p>



<p>Humans have used medical cannabis and cannabinoid derivatives to 
treat and prevent issues from pain to nausea to migraines to stress and 
anxiety. CBD oil, which does not contain the intoxicant THC, has seen a 
major spike in use as both a treatment and a supplement, as it has 
indications for prevention of inflammation and even cancer. And, 
importantly, the naturally occurring ingredients used in CBD oil 
products are safely absorbed into the body, avoiding the potential risks
 of side effects, adverse reactions and further injury.</p>



<p>The evidence of successful use of CBD oil for human health is mounting. Market research firm Brightfield Group released a <a href="https://www.brightfieldgroup.com/cbd-study-summary">study</a>in
 August 2017 of 2400 users of medical cannabis website Hello MD, showing
 that 42 percent of respondents claiming they had given up 
pharmaceutical drugs in favor of cannabis products.&nbsp; 80 percent stated 
that they consume CBD in some form at least once a week and 41 percent 
use it every day.</p>



<p>Much like doctors for humans, veterinarians are bombarded with 
marketing and incentives encouraging them to prescribe the latest 
pharmaceuticals. The fact that many people have replaced their 
prescriptions with CBD might be making the pharma companies nervous 
enough to push their product even more heavily in the veterinary space.</p>



<p>It’s important to advocate for your pet the same way you would <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">for  yourself</g> and your human family members. Since our dogs can’t verbally tell us how they’re feeling, natural remedies like CBD oil can help ease any worries you might have about side effects or secondary conditions,  while giving you confidence in the efficacy of the treatment.</p>



<p>Many of the proven benefits of CBD in humans can be extended to dogs as well, in fact, dogs can benefit from CBD even more than humans because they have more receptors in their endocannabinoid system. CBD  contains compounds that interact naturally with dogs’ immune and nervous systems. It also contains essential fatty acids that dogs need in their diets to help them recover from illnesses and to prevent diseases.</p>



<p>Therapeutic&nbsp;hemp CBD oil for dogscan minimize canine anxiety, reduce 
harmful bacteria, treat hot spots and skin problems, ease pain, reduce 
seizures, promote heart health, heal autoimmune diseasesand even halt 
cancerous tumor growth.Importantly,CBD oil does not require a 
prescription and the cost is roughly on par with typical 
over-the-counter medications, so you can give your dogs the care they 
need without breaking the bank.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating component of the cannabis plant, has generated significant interest among scientists and physicians in recent years—but how CBD exerts its therapeutic impact on a molecular level is still being sorted out. Cannabidiol  is a pleiotropic drug in that it produces many effects through multiple  molecular pathways. The scientific literature has identified more than  65 molecular targets of CBD.</p>



<p>Although CBD has little binding affinity for either of the two cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), cannabidiol modulates several non-cannabinoid receptors and ion channels. CBD also acts through various receptor-independent pathways—for example, by delaying the “reuptake” of endogenous neurotransmitters (such as anandamide and adenosine) and by enhancing or inhibiting the binding action of certain G-protein coupled receptors.</p>



<p>Here are some of the ways that CBD confers its manifold therapeutic effects.</p>



<h3>Serotonin Receptors</h3>



<p>Jose Alexandre Crippa and his colleagues at the University of San 
Paulo in Brazil and King’s College in London have conducted pioneering 
research into <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBD and the neural correlates of anxiety</a>. At high concentrations, CBD directly activates the 5-HT1A
 (hydroxytryptamine) serotonin receptor, thereby conferring an 
anti-anxiety effect. This G-coupled protein receptor is implicated in a 
range of biological and neurological processes, including (but not 
limited to) anxiety, addiction, appetite, sleep, pain perception, nausea
 and vomiting.</p>



<p>5-HT1A is a member of the family of 5-HT receptors, which are activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin. Found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, 5-HT
 receptors trigger various intracellular cascades of chemical messages 
to produce either an excitatory or inhibitory response, depending on the
 chemical context of the message.</p>



<p>CBDA [Cannabidiolic acid], the raw, unheated version of CBD that is present in the cannabis plant, also has a strong affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (even more so than CBD). Preclinical studies indicate that CBDA is a potent anti-emetic, stronger than either CBD or THC, which also have anti-nausea properties.</p>



<h3>Vanilloid Receptors</h3>



<p>CBD directly interacts with various ion channels to confer a therapeutic effect. CBD, for example, binds to TRPV1 receptors, which also function as ion channels. TRPV1 is known to mediate pain perception, inflammation and body temperature.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.optimizepc.org/windowsdatarecovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vanilla-cbd-cannabinoid-receptors.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-159" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vanilla-cbd-cannabinoid-receptors.jpg 847w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vanilla-cbd-cannabinoid-receptors-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/vanilla-cbd-cannabinoid-receptors-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>TRPV is the technical abbreviation for “transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V.” TRPV1 is one of several dozen TRP (pronounced “trip”) receptor variants or subfamilies that mediate the effects of a wide range of medicinal herbs.</p>



<p>Scientists also refer to TRPV1 as a 
“vanilloid receptor,” named after the flavorful vanilla bean. Vanilla 
contains eugenol, an essential oil that has antiseptic and analgesic 
properties; it also helps to unclog blood vessels. Historically, the 
vanilla bean has been used as a folk cure for headaches.</p>



<p>CBD binds to TRPV1, which can influence pain perception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capsaicin—the pungent compound in hot chili peppers—activates the TRVP1 receptor. Anandamide, the endogenous cannabinoid, is also a TRPV1 agonist.</p>



<h3>GPR55—orphan receptors</h3>



<p>The program always comes in three types: the $49 (Home), which retrieves from all the above media files except the optical; the $99 (Professional), which performs optical as well as, the adds support for producing images and retrieving files from Outlook (.pst files); and the $299 (Technician edition), which handles RAID (0, 5, 6) volumes and remote network retrieval. In addition <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">to</g>, While Stellar Phoenix Windows Data Recovery interface is quite colorful and very convenient to use, where there is a great chance to recover vast lists of lost files as well as, the chance when looking for lost volumes.</p>



<p>Whereas cannabidiol directly activates the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor and several TRPV ion channels, some studies indicate that CBD functions as an antagonist that blocks, or deactivates, another G protein-coupled receptor known as GPR55.</p>



<p>GPR55 has been dubbed an “orphan receptor” because scientists are still not sure if it belongs to a larger family of receptors. GPR55
 is widely expressed in the brain, especially in the cerebellum. It is 
involved in modulating blood pressure and bone density, among other 
physiological processes.</p>



<p>GPR55 promotes osteoclast cell function, which facilitates bone reabsorption. Overactive GPR55 receptor signaling is associated with osteoporosis.</p>



<p>GPR55, when activated, also promotes cancer cell proliferation, according to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v30/n2/full/onc2010502a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2010 study by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> in Shanghai. This receptor is expressed in various types of cancer.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2737440/" target="_blank">CBD is a GPR55 antagonist</a>,  as University of Aberdeen scientist Ruth Ross disclosed at the 2010  conference of the International Cannabinoid Research Society in Lund,  Sweden. By blocking GPR55 signaling, CBD may act to decrease both bone reabsorption and cancer cell proliferation.</p>



<h3>PPARs &#8211; nuclear receptors</h3>



<p>CBD also exerts an anti-cancer effect by activating PPARs (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors) that are situated on the surface of the cell’s nucleus. Activation of the receptor known as PPAR-gamma has an anti-proliferative effect as well as an ability to induce tumor regression in human lung cancer cell lines. PPAR-gamma activation degrades amyloid-beta plaque, a key molecule linked to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. This is one of the reasons why cannabidiol, a PPAR-gamma agonist, may be a useful remedy for Alzheimer’s patients.</p>



<p>PPAR receptors also regulate genes that are involved in energy homeostasis, lipid uptake, insulin sensitivity, and other metabolic functions. Diabetics, accordingly, may benefit from a CBD-rich treatment regimen.</p>

<h4>CBD as a reuptake inhibitor</h4>



<p>How does CBD, an exogenous plant compound,  get inside a human cell to bind to a nuclear receptor? First it has to  pass through the cell membrane by hitching a ride with a fatty acid  binding protein (FABP), which chaperones various lipid molecules into the cell’s interior. These intracellular transport molecules also escort tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the brain’s own marijuana-like molecules, the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2AG, across the membrane to several targets within the cell. CBD and THC both modulate receptors on the surface of the nucleus, which regulate gene expression and mitochondrial activity.</p>



<p>CBD also exerts an anti-cancer effect by activating PPARs on the surface of the cell’s nucleus.</p>



<p>Cannabidiol, it turns out, has a strong affinity for three kinds of FABPs, and CBD
 competes with our endocannabinoids, which are fatty acids, for the same
 transport molecules. Once it is inside the cell, anandamide is broken 
down by FAAH [fatty acid amide hydrolase], a metabolic enzyme, as part of its natural molecular life cycle. But CBD interferes with this process by reducing anandamide’s access to FABP transport molecules and delaying endocannabinoid passage into the cell’s interior.</p>



<p>According to a team of Stony Brook University scientists, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27790143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBD functions as an anandamide reuptake</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25666611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and breakdown inhibitor</a>,
 thereby raising endocannabinoid levels in the brain’s synapses. 
Enhancing endocannabinod tone via reuptake inhibition may be a key 
mechanism whereby CBD confers neuroprotective effects against seizures, as well as many other health benefits.</p>



<p>CBD’s anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety effects are in part attributable to its inhibition of adenosine reuptake. By delaying the reuptake of this neurotransmitter, CBD boosts adenosine levels in the brain, which regulates adenosine receptor activity. A1A and A2A  adenosine receptors play significant roles in cardiovascular function,  regulating myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow. These  receptors have broad anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body.</p>



<h4>CBD as an allosteric modulator</h4>



<p>CBD also functions as an allosteric 
receptor modulator, which means that it can either enhance or inhibit 
how a receptor transmits a signal by changing the shape of the receptor.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.optimizepc.org/windowsdatarecovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-non-psychoactive.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-161" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-non-psychoactive.jpg 847w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-non-psychoactive-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-non-psychoactive-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Australian scientists report that CBD acts as a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“positive allosteric modulator”</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28249817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> of the GABA-A receptor</a>. In other words, CBD interacts with the GABA-A
 receptor in a way that enhances the receptor’s binding affinity for its
 principal endogenous agonist, gamma-Aminobutyric acid&nbsp; (GABA),
 which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central 
nervous system. The sedating effects of Valium and other Benzos are 
mediated by GABA receptor transmission. CBD reduces anxiety by changing the shape of the GABA-A receptor in a way that amplifies the natural calming effect of GABA.</p>



<p>Canadian scientists have identified CBD as a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.13250/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“negative allosteric modulator” of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor</a>, which is concentrated in the brain and central nervous system. While cannabidiol doesn’t bind to the CB1 receptor directly like THC does, CBD interacts allosterically with CB1 and changes the shape of the receptor in a way that weakens CB1’s ability to bind with THC.</p>



<p>As a negative allosteric modulator of the CB1 receptor, CBD lowers the ceiling on THC’s psychoactivity—which is why people don’t feel as “high” when using CBD-rich cannabis compared to when they consume THC-dominant medicine. A CBD-rich product with little THC can convey therapeutic benefits without having a euphoric or dysphoric effect.</p>

<p>Hemp oil for dogs is becoming increasingly popular among holistic veterinarians and pet owners seeking alternative, all-natural solutions for common pet health concerns. Though cannabidiol (CBD) has been gaining acceptance as a legitimate medical treatment for humans for the past decade, medical researchers are now discovering numerous health-enhancing benefits for pets, too. Here are five things about hemp oil for dogs that you might not have known.</p>



<h3>1. Hemp and marijuana aren’t the same thing.</h3>



<p>While the terms marijuana and hemp are often used interchangeably, 
they are actually two varieties of cannabis sativa. Hemp doesn’t contain
 significant amounts of the compound tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which 
is the element that delivers the intoxicating effect commonly associated
 with marijuana consumption. What hemp does contain, however, is high 
amounts of CBD, which is a compound used for its medical properties.</p>



<p>Hemp and marijuana plants are cultivated differently. Because hemp <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">is  used</g> for a wide variety of industrial applications (clothing fibers,  construction materials, paper), it is bred for sturdiness and can be grown easily in different climates. Marijuana is difficult to cultivate in certain <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="9" data-gr-id="9">climates,</g> and has been bred to maximize production of trichomes that contain THC, which are negligible in hemp stalks.</p>



<h3>2. Hemp oil CBD for dogs is not psychoactive.</h3>



<p>CBD oil for dogs and humans does not contain the mind-altering 
compound THC that is found in marijuana; neither you nor your pet will 
become intoxicated from use of hemp oil for dogs (or people).</p>



<p>DO NOT give dogs any product containing THC – it is toxic to dogs.</p>



<h3>3. Hemp oil for dogs may increase heart health.</h3>



<p>Hemp oil for pets has been shown to help <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579247/">promote cardiovascular health</a> by helping to slow damage to blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and even to regulate heart rhythm.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.optimizepc.org/mediawidget" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8188rhZBQuL._SL1500_-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-169" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8188rhZBQuL._SL1500_-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8188rhZBQuL._SL1500_-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8188rhZBQuL._SL1500_-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8188rhZBQuL._SL1500_.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h4><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.optimizepc.org/mediawidget" target="_blank"><strong>Click Here</strong></a></h4>



<h3>4. Hemp oil for dogs can help with allergy symptoms.</h3>



<p>CBD has been found to be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/">an anti-inflammatory agent</a>
 that can modify allergic responses at a cellular level. For pets, hemp 
oil for allergies has been found to be an effective symptom reducer if 
your pet is highly sensitive to certain man-made and/or environmental 
elements.</p>



<h4>5. Hemp oil for dogs helps alleviate dogs’ anxiety</h4>



<p>Hemp oil for dogs can help to reduce the stress response in pets that become anxious or nervous during thunderstorms or around people may have encountered several issues with the missing components.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The non-psychoactive, highly therapeutic compound known as cannabidiol (CBD) has opened up a new channel of alternative therapy for pets. As more people start to familiarize themselves with the healing properties of cannabinoids, it might be time to consider the use of CBD  as a viable treatment option for man’s best friend.</p>



<p>CBD oil is characterized by its low dosage of THC, making it an 
attractive option for humans and animals, especially those who prefer to
 avoid any psychoactive effects. CBD has been shown to alleviate a 
variety of ailments, such as arthritis, inflammation, stress disorders, 
anxiety, chronic pain, and seizures. Overall, early research indicates 
that CBD is a versatile compound with an assortment of benefits that can
 help ease your pet’s discomfort.</p>



<p>To help pet owners looking to try CBD oil for their pets,  we’ve broken down the best ways to administer hemp oil. The most popular types of CBD products are CBD hemp extracts, tinctures, topical creams, and edibles.</p>



<h3>CBD Oil Extracts</h3>



<p>CBD oil allows for more precise dosage and quicker reaction time than
 that of edibles. It offers pet owners control over how much CBD their 
canine is ingesting, and acts more like an oil-based health supplement 
rather than a recreational cannabis product.</p>



<p>CBD potency measures at a variety of levels, ranging from pure CBD to  a mix of CBD and THC. Many CBD pet treat manufacturers are adamant  about only using hemp CBD oils for their products, due to the dangers  that THC poses to pets. However, some manufacturers still prefer to use  the full-spectrum oil, which includes a combination of CBD and THC. One  of these companies, Bark Avenue, says the full therapeutic properties of  the cannabis plant cannot be felt without using BOTH of the cannabinoids. Sometimes these THC-CBD ratios, if dosed correctly, have  been seen to be useful for more severe symptoms and conditions.</p>



<p>Dog owners should always consider where CBD oil brands  source their oil from. It’s important to ensure the oil is sourced from  reputable suppliers that conduct third party lab tests. Another  important factor is to consult with a qualified veterinarian to discuss  the most appropriate course of treatment for their trusty sidekick. Oil  extracts are much more potent compared to other CBD products, and that  is why they are used as the foundation for some of the other cannabis  concentrates that we will discuss below.</p>



<h4>Tinctures</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-tinctures-for-dogs.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-174" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-tinctures-for-dogs.jpg 600w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-tinctures-for-dogs-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Tinctures come in a form of a bottle and dropper to administer the 
oil to your pets. While not as potent as extracts, it does well for 
those who are looking to relieve more mild symptoms like muscle pains, 
nausea, stress or anxiety. It’s a great entry point for pet owners who 
are still wary of hemp-based treatments.</p>



<p>Tinctures are liquid hemp extracts made by infusing CBD compounds with mixtures of vegetable glycerine, oil, or alcohol. It is essentially a cannabis-infused solution. Tinctures are administered orally, and a  dose consists of a few drops placed under the tongue. This delivery method helps the compound be absorbed more efficiently into the bloodstream, allowing for better dosage control and immediate relief. It provides moderate or low CBD potency with a variety of flavors. CBD  tinctures are a great option for pet parents who want to integrate CBD  as a daily dietary supplement for their pup. CBD tinctures have been shown to alleviate symptoms such as nausea, body aches, seizures,  anxiety, and loss of appetite for dogs facing the pains of old age.</p>



<h4>CBD Topicals</h4>



<p>Hemp-infused topicals are a traditional remedy for individuals and 
animals suffering from body aches and joint pains. Topicals are applied 
directly on the skin, delivering immediate localized relief. Only for 
external use, the salves and creams are absorbed into the skin to treat 
allergic reactions, weak joints, muscle pain and inflammation. Most 
cannabis topicals are mixed with other therapeutic compounds like 
essential oils and herbal extracts to provide an additional layer of 
healing effects for you and your pet. These balms and creams made from 
CBD are a great option for those who need consistent relief throughout 
the day.</p>



<p>The CBD potency level for topical products is moderate compared to 
pure CBD oil. This transdermal treatment option does not reach the 
bloodstream–meaning even if the topical had a trace amount of THC you 
still will not feel the “high” you’d get from smoking or ingesting it.</p>



<p>From skin allergies to arthritis pains, CBD-rich topicals can provide
 localized pain relief and immediate soothing sensations. Some brands 
infused their CBD topicals with other compounds like cooling menthol or a
 warming agent to help speed up the healing process. Geriatric dogs 
facing joint pain or weak bones can experience the strong painkilling 
properties of CBD. While other dogs with itchiness and skin issues will 
be able to rest more comfortable with the calming effects of these 
topicals.</p>



<p>For pet owners who see their dogs suffering from arthritis and skin irritations, topical CBD treatments may be worth considering. People would be surprised to see the difference one remedy makes for the overall health and happiness of their canine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-for-pets-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-175" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-for-pets-1.jpg 750w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbd-for-pets-1-300x137.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption><em>If you don’t purchase from reputable sources there is a real and  present danger that you could end up giving your pet a CBD product that  has high psychoactivity or toxicity level.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h4>Edibles</h4>



<p>If you have a dog, you know how difficult it is to feed them 
medications. They somehow manage to eat the entire treat except for the 
medicine pill. Administering the oil through a tincture could also be 
equally challenging, as your dog avoids to open her mouth and runs away.
 <a href="https://simplewag.com/cbd-dog-treats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CBD dog treats</a>
 give you the option to treat your pet with a pain relieving compound 
while providing them with an easy to swallow and enjoyable snack. With 
all the delicious flavor combinations available, your pet will not be 
able to tell the difference between their favorite treat and medicine. 
Over time, they may even become one in the same!</p>



<p>Pet edibles are made by mixing CBD oils with dog treat ingredients. 
CBD is commonly found infused within the butter or added directly to the
 recipe as the oil extract. Unlike tinctures and other delivery methods,
 edibles take longer to absorb. This delay poses a danger for pets 
because after they eat a CBD treat they may seem okay and exhibit no 
side effects, and you may even want to give them more to make sure it’s 
working. That is a bad idea!</p>



<p>Due to the digestive process, edibles take much longer to kick in and
 can have varying levels of potency. Pet owners must follow the proper 
pet dosage guidelines (especially with edibles) and always start off 
with the smallest amount to see how your pet reacts. The biggest risk of
 edibles is overconsumption.</p>



<p>Ultimately, CBD dog treats are an excellent choice when consumed responsibly!</p>



<h4>Correct Dosage: How much is too much?</h4>



<p>The most common side effect of CBD overconsumption is drowsiness. More serious side effects can include excessive itching or mild vomiting. With proper dosing and careful observation, these side effects are seldom encountered. However,  if your dog does react with these symptoms or exhibits greater sensitivity to CBD, you should stop providing the hemp oil immediately and consult your vet before proceeding any further.</p>



<p>Patience is key when treating your pet with hemp-based products. It’s important to pay attention to dosing guidelines and always start with the lowest dose to monitor and observe the effect it has on your pup.  Once you have a better idea of how your pet can process CBD, you can then increase the dosage if you find they have more severe pain.</p>



<h4>Future of cannabis-based Pet Treatments</h4>



<p>Since cannabis remains as a Schedule I drug in the U.S., 
veterinarians are hesitant to prescribe cannabis treatments to their 
patients. Pure cannabis (high THC) is very toxic for pets. The 
consumption of psychoactive cannabis can cause seizures, stomach 
problems, and severe respiratory issues for dogs. The growing popularity
 of marijuana edibles has resulted in a wave of pet hospitalizations due
 to cannabis ingestion. Veterinarians are seeing more cases of pets 
accidentally eating their owner’s “pot” or edibles stash. With the 
unregulated nature of the cannabis market, if you don’t purchase from 
reputable sources there is a real and present danger that you could end 
up giving your pet a CBD product that has high THC or toxicity level.</p>



<p>Hemp derived CBD oil for pets  have become a popular treatment for pet parents seeking more holistic  pain relief without the legal implications of marijuana. Hemp is a  legally sold substance in the United States. You can find hemp CBD  products in various shops across the US, especially in the dispensaries  where these CBD products have become big sellers among the pet  communities.</p>



<p>Putting a stop to the stigma behind medical marijuana will require a  significant amount of scientific research. However, CBD’s medicinal future looks promising due to its unique compound structure that allows people and animals to experience the therapeutic effects of cannabis,  without the psychoactive effects. These new modes of CBD consumption are helping people see the great potential CBD has. With further research and changing perceptions, we hope to see more pets experience the pain-relieving sensations of medical cannabis.</p>

<p>With all the attention CBD has been getting, it’s easy to find information on all its benefits — but is there a downside? <em>Does CBD have any side effects?</em></p>



<p>To create this article, we looked at both scientific research and anecdotal reports from CBD users. From our in-depth research, what we found suggests that the side effects of CBD oil are usually minor, and, for most people, the benefits far outweigh the rare reports of discomfort.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="http://www.optimizepc.org/expressuninstaller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cbd-for-pets-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-186" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cbd-for-pets-2.jpg 750w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/cbd-for-pets-2-300x133.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></a><figcaption>D<em>oes CBD oil have side effects? If so, what are they?</em></figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>The War on Drugs Hurts Cannabis &amp; Hemp Research</h3>



<p>Due to the the stigma associated with the war on drugs, free and open research into both hemp and its close relative, psychoactive cannabis, is only just beginning in many ways.</p>



<p>For example, the first study into the benefits of <a href="http://www.maps.org/research/mmj/marijuana-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cannabis in veterans</a>
 with otherwise untreatable post-traumatic stress disorder is beginning 
in 2017, but only after the researchers involved struggled through years
 of red tape and put their careers at risk in order to do promote the 
need for this vital research. Fortunately, their work, and that of 
others like them, have begun to peel back the bureaucracy preventing 
scientific research.</p>



<p>On the hemp side of the equation, the 2014 Farm Bill which legalized 
the growth and sales of agricultural hemp in the U.S., and the 
production of its derivatives like CBD oil, should help to open the way 
for research into the benefits and possibilities of hemp in all its 
forms. While we’ll summarize some of what we’ve found from our research 
into CBD side effects below, we expect to see a lot more research in 
this field in the years to come.</p>



<h3>CBD Oil Studies Find Few Side Effects</h3>



<p>Although <g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="3" data-gr-id="3">the medical</g> research is still in its preliminary stages,  scientists have devoted considerable effort to <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">proving</g> that CBD oil <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">is  safe</g> for human and animal consumption.</p>



<p>A <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00207458608985678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>
 published in 1986 in the International Journal of Neuroscience, 
examined the effects of CBD oil in 5 patients with dystonic movement 
disorders (muscle tremors and other forms of uncontrollable movements). 
CBD oil’s side effects “were mild and included hypotension [low blood 
pressure], dry mouth, psychomotor slowing [slowed thoughts or 
movements], lightheadedness, and sedation,” according to the study’s 
authors, Paul Consroe, Reuven Sandyk and Stuart R. Snider.</p>



<p>According to this study, CBD seemed to help people with their 
dystonia, but might have made some symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease 
(found in 2 of the study’s subjects) a little bit worse. However, other,
 more recent research has found that CBD can <a href="http://www.medicalmarijuanainc.com/parkinsons-disease-medical-marijuana-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benefit Parkinson’s patients</a>.</p>



<p>One study of 8 healthy volunteers and 15 patients with epilepsy, <a href="https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/137430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>
 in 1980 in Pharmacology, looked at the side-effects of CBD when 
consumed daily for a month. “All patients and volunteers tolerated CBD 
very well and no signs of toxicity or serious side effects were detected
 on examination,” wrote the researchers, who also found that CBD can 
help some people with epilepsy.</p>



<h3>Consuming higher dosage of CBD caused no toxicity</h3>



<p>In 2006, a group of researchers studying the potential benefits of  CBD in treating psychosis and <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="4" data-gr-id="4">anxiety,</g> looked at several studies of CBD  oil’s safety and summarized their findings in a paper published by the  Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research. Noting that CBD  safety was first proven through animal research, the scientists added:<br></p>



<p>“Acute CBD administration by the oral, inhalatory or intravenous 
route did not induce any significant toxic effect in humans. In 
addition, chronic administration of CBD for 30 days to healthy 
volunteers, at daily doses ranging from 10 to 400 mg, failed to induce 
any significant alteration in neurological, psychiatric or clinical 
exams. Finally, in patients suffering from Huntington’s disease, daily 
doses of CBD (700 mg) for 6 weeks did not induce any toxicity. 
Therefore, confirming results from animal studies, the available clinical data suggest that CBD can be safely administered over a wide dose range.“</p>



<p>A 2007 study published in Phytomedicine found that CBD, along with other similar substances including THC (the main active ingredient in psychoactive cannabis), has potential as an anticoagulant, so people with who have diseases like hemophilia that cause problems with blood clotting should use extra caution with these substances.</p>



<h3>An Anecdotal look at CBD Oil side effects show quality matters</h3>



<p>Of course, since many of these studies have small sample sizes, and  every person reacts a little bit differently to any substance, we looked  at CBD oil users’ anecdotal reports, posted on popular online  communities and forums, such as Reddit and sites that sell CBD products.</p>



<p>A handful of very sensitive people who use CBD oil report feeling a mild mood and mind-altering effects, similar to a low dose of psychoactive cannabis, but these effects appear to be rare. Some people also reported mild digestive upset, including diarrhea, from ingesting  CBD oil.</p>



<p>According to one <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CBD/comments/4bnoes/does_anyone_else_get_headaches_from_cbd_oil/" target="_blank">post</a> on Reddit, some people get headaches from using CBD oil, which is a bit unusual since CBD can also sometimes be used to treat migraines. However, other Redditors have suggested the problem was actually the purity of the CBD extract.</p>



<p>“I have just recently started taking CBD for headaches, and after three weeks of getting worse headaches, I finally figured out that my  CBD oil was cheap crap — and that a LOT of it is,” a Redditor named  Pellquin wrote last year.</p>



<h4>When it comes to CBD, Purity &amp; Source Matters</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-188" srcset="https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1.jpg 1000w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1-300x135.jpg 300w, https://cbd-greatness.github.io/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/CBD-Side-Effects-v1-768x346.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p><g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">Pellquin</g> had it right: unfortunately, there’s a lot of poor quality  CBD oil from unreliable brands. The CBD oil market is still in its infancy, and it can be challenging for consumers to educate themselves except through expensive trial and error. </p>



<p>CBD oil is a poorly regulated market and most products are imported  from overseas. Since hemp absorbs chemicals from the ground, including  lead and mercury, growing conditions can make a big difference.  Labelling of CBD products is also often inconsistent and unclear, making  it confusing for CBD consumers to know what they’re buying.</p>



<p>Three pieces of advice for buying CBD oil:</p>



<ul><li><em>Always ask for third party lab results when buying CBD oil</em></li><li><em>Pay close attention to product labeling</em></li><li><em>Don’t hesitate to ask a more knowledgeable expert for help.</em></li></ul>



<h4>CBD is Safe, But Research Before You Buy &amp; Use</h4>



<p>Overall, we found that scientists and doctors consider CBD oil to be 
safe for most people to use, and there are few, if any, serious side 
effects.</p>



<p>While everyone has their own unique body chemistry, it seems like the
 vast majority of people can ingest CBD oil without ever feeling any 
unpleasant side effects at all, and the remaining few will mostly likely
 experience only minor symptoms like stomach upset or dry mouth. Since 
scientists are using pure extracts from known sources, it’s likely that 
some consumer reports of headaches or other minor adverse reactions 
could be due to impurities in inferior CBD products.</p>



<p>As always, you should closely research the products you buy, and 
consult with a medical expert if you have any doubt about the best or 
safest way to use CBD oil.</p>

<p>Flying with CBD oil seems like a natural choice. And now, we’re happy to report you can safely bring it on domestic flights.</p>



<p>CBD is a wonderful addition to your daily supplements,  and it’s only natural that you’ll want to take it with you on trips and vacations. Fortunately, recent changes to Transportation Security  Administration policy now make it possible to fly with CBD.</p>

<p>Below, we’ll share a few tips for flying with CBD. Please note, this article only applies to flights within the U.S. Consult with customs officials or legal experts before bringing CBD on any international flights.</p>



<h3>What the TSA says about flying with CBD</h3>



<p>In December 2018, the United States legalized hemp products  with an amendment to the passage of the Agriculture Improvement Act of  2018, better known as the Farm Bill. This major change completely took  hemp and hemp products out from under the of control of the Drug  Enforcement Administration.</p>



<p>It still took months, <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/tsa-updates-marijuana-rules-to-allow-hemp-derived-cbd-on-flights/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">until May of this year</a>, for the TSA to catch up.</p>



<p>Although hemp and “marijuana” are different, the TSA policy on CBD is still found under its entry on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/medical-marijuana" target="_blank">flying with medical marijuana</a>:</p>



<p>Marijuana and certain cannabis infused 
products, including some Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, remain illegal under 
federal law except for products that contain no more than 0.3 percent 
THC on a dry weight basis or that are approved by FDA.</p>



<p>In plain English, the Farm Bill defined (and legalized) hemp as a 
form of the cannabis plant with under 0.3% THC, the component of 
marijuana that makes people feel high. Any hemp products which meet this
 legal requirement for low THC content, such as the <a href="https://ministryofhemp.com/cbd/reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal CBD products</a>
 sold throughout the U.S., can now be brought on a plane. Other 
cannabis-derived products are also allowed on the plane if they’re 
approved by the FDA. Currently only one medication, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-drug-comprised-active-ingredient-derived-marijuana-treat-rare-severe-forms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epidiolex</a>, meets that requirement.</p>



<h4>Tips for flying with CBD</h4>



<p>CBD now falls under the same regulations covering all other items you bring through security. That includes regulations restricting liquids.</p>



<p>Here’s some tips for bringing different types of CBD supplements on a plane:</p>



<ul><li><em>CBD capsules — </em>In general, pills and capsules don’t need any special treatment. Even “softgels” aren’t considered liquids when flying.</li><li><em>CBD gummies and other edibles — </em>It’s not routine, but  occasionally TSA agents do request screening of food. In that case,  remove your CBD edibles for screening along with any snacks you’re  carrying.</li><li><em>CBD tinctures, oil and topicals — </em>Like all liquids or gels, you will either need to put this product in your checked bag or make sure you meet <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fodors.com/news/311-tips-4779" target="_blank">the 3-1-1 travel rules</a>. That includes all CBD oils and tinctures, and topical CBD like balms or salves.</li><li><em>CBD vapes — </em><strong>Don’t</strong> put CBD vape pens or vape batteries in your checked bags due to the risk of fire. Anything with a rechargeable battery <strong>must</strong> be carried onto the plane. Vape cartridges or small vape “juice” bottles can go in your ziplock baggie or your checked bag.</li></ul>



<h4>Final tips on traveling with CBD</h4>



<p>We were thrilled to hear that the TSA had changed their guidelines on  CBD. CBD is a super-supplement providing many benefits for travelers  including reducing inflammation and symptoms of anxiety.</p>



<p>Even under these updated guidelines, TSA agents at the security 
checkpoint always have the final say whether any item makes it through.</p>



<p>If your CBD is turned away for some reason, you could take a dose 
before entering security and then either mail the product to yourself, 
or discard it and buy new CBD at your final destination. If this 
happens, it certainly sounds inconvenient, frustrating, and even 
expensive. But it’s better than missing a flight or causing a serious 
delay for yourself or others.</p>



<p>In general, thanks to changing laws and the changing American culture, you should be able to fly with CBD without worrying.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you have an important message to convey to another person, a 
message with crucial details. The person waiting for your message is 
responsible for relaying this vital information so each member of their 
team can make appropriate adjustments to their assigned task. Now 
imagine what could happen if your message never made it to your intended
 recipient.</p>



<p>This same type of communication breakdown can happen 
in your body. Nearly every essential function necessary for your 
survival is regulated by an elaborate system of messengers and 
receptors, your Endocannabinoid System (ECS). To understand the health 
and wellness potential of CBD, it’s helpful to understand the role of 
your ECS receptors and how they function within this system.</p>



<h2><strong>What Are CBD Receptors?</strong></h2>



<p>The
 receptors often referred to as CBD receptors, are technically known as 
cannabinoid receptors. These essential G-protein receptors are located 
on the surface of cells throughout your body, from your brain to your 
nerve endings. Your cannabinoid receptors receive information from your 
Endocannabinoid System messengers and use this information to initiate 
an appropriate response. Since cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid, a 
lipid that functions as a neurotransmitter, it interacts with the 
receptors of your Endocannabinoid System.</p>



<h2><strong>What is the Endocannabinoid System (ECS)?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Your Endocannabinoid System  is the largest system of neurotransmitters and receptors in your body.  It’s your ECS that modulates your brain function, organ function, and  keeps essential endocrine processes functioning efficiently. Your ECS is  instrumental to so many important functions that many researchers today  believe it is responsible for homeostasis, the processes that restore  balance when functions in your body are disrupted by internal or  external forces.<sup>1</sup></p>



<h3><strong>Regulating Bodily Functions</strong></h3>



<p>The
 response initiated by your endocannabinoid receptors is dependent on 
the chemical composition of the message it receives. The interaction 
between the messenger and receptor will determine the appropriate 
response, and excitatory response, inhibitory response, or secondary 
message to other regulatory systems. Just a few of the many processes 
regulated by the functions of your Endocannabinoid System include:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Sleep Regulation</strong> Your sleep cycles are regulated by circadian rhythms, the 24-hour internal clock that regulates numerous essential functions.<sup>2</sup>  While your circadian rhythms are regulated by your exposure to light  and darkness; it’s the function of your Endocannabinoid System that  regulates your circadian rhythms and stabilizes sleep cycles, as well as  numerous processes that can interfere with restful sleep.<sup>3</sup></li><li><strong>Metabolism and Appetite </strong>Your metabolism, also regulated by the ECS, is determined by the <g class="gr_ gr_40 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="40" data-gr-id="40">complex  interaction</g> of your gastrointestinal system, liver, muscle, and <g class="gr_ gr_41 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="41" data-gr-id="41">fat  storage</g>. The activation of CBD receptors modulates nutrient processing,  appetite regulation, fat distribution, and metabolic pathways.<sup>4</sup></li><li><strong>Moods and Emotions </strong><g class="gr_ gr_42 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="42" data-gr-id="42">The  endocannabinoid</g> receptors in your amygdala regulate emotional <g class="gr_ gr_43 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="43" data-gr-id="43">responses  and</g> memories. The role of the ECS and our emotions has been <g class="gr_ gr_44 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="44" data-gr-id="44">clearly  established</g>, affecting our feelings of happiness as strongly <g class="gr_ gr_45 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="45" data-gr-id="45">as  depression</g> or anxiety. The endocannabinoid receptors in the emotional  centers of your brain influence the release of serotonin, dopamine and  other neurotransmitters that have a direct impact on your mood.<sup>5</sup></li><li><strong>Immune System Function </strong>Your  Endocannabinoid System is believed to be the driving force of <g class="gr_ gr_46 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="46" data-gr-id="46">your  immune</g> system. The organs and cells of your immune system, <g class="gr_ gr_47 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="47" data-gr-id="47">including  your</g> mast cells, T-cells, tonsils, and lymphocytes are rich <g class="gr_ gr_48 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="48" data-gr-id="48">with  endocannabinoid</g> receptors.

<h2><strong>The Two CBD Receptors</strong></h2>



<p>It’s  the interaction between messengers and receptors that keeps your  Endocannabinoid System working efficiently and effectively. There are  two different types of endocannabinoid receptors in your body. They are  easy to remember, CB1 and CB2. While both receptors are found throughout  your body, they are found in different concentrations within specific areas. For example:</p>



<ul><li><strong>CB1 Receptors</strong> CB1  receptors are found most abundantly in your central nervous system,  your brain, and the spinal cord. The location of the receptor will influence its basic function. While the CB1 receptors in your amygdala regulate your emotional responses and memory, the CB1 receptors in your hypothalamus help regulate your metabolic processes.</li><li><strong>CB2 Receptors</strong><g class="gr_ gr_14 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="14" data-gr-id="14"> </g>The  receptors found most abundantly in your peripheral nervous system <g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="15" data-gr-id="15">are  your</g> CB2 receptors. Your peripheral nervous system extends from <g class="gr_ gr_16 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="16" data-gr-id="16">your  spinal</g> column to your organs, muscles, and other areas of your body. CB2  receptors are intricately involved in immune system function <g class="gr_ gr_17 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="17" data-gr-id="17">and  inflammatory</g> responses.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>How CBD Receptors Respond to CBD Intake</strong></h2>



<p>Soon
 after the discovery of your endocannabinoid receptors, researchers 
discovered that our bodies manufacture cannabinoids. The two main 
cannabinoids made in your body (anandamide and 2-AG) are called 
endocannabinoids. In a perfect world, your body would make all the 
endocannabinoids needed to interact with the endocannabinoid receptors. 
But it does not always work that way. When there are not enough 
messengers to interact with the cannabinoid receptors, the message is 
lost.</p>



<p>CBD mimics the effects of the cannabinoids created in your body and interacts with the endocannabinoid and several non-endocannabinoid receptors.  When you take hemp-derived CBD, the cannabinoids circulate through your body until they find a receptor they can connect with, attaching to neurons. Since so many essential functions are dependent on the messengers and receptors of your ECS, the effects are dependent on the system influenced.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether it’s the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, New Year’s Eve, or Memorial  Day, when humans light up the sky with fireworks, there are many dogs  who will be trembling with fear. No loving dog owner likes to see their  pet cowering in terror, but fireworks <strong>anxiety in dogs</strong>  is very common. So, what can you do to help your dog when fireworks are  being used? What can you give a dog for fireworks anxiety? </p>



<p>If  you search the internet for what can I give my dog for fireworks  anxiety, you will find that some people recommend anti-anxiety drugs.  Many people, though, don’t like giving their pets drugs if there is a  natural alternative. That’s why so many dog lovers have started to use  CBD products to calm their dog’s distress. </p>



<p>If
 you have a dog who is petrified of fireworks, here’s all the 
information you need on why your pet is frightened by fireworks and what
 you can do about it this 4th of July.</p>



<h3>Why Is My Dog Scared of Fireworks?</h3>



<p>The main reason that dogs are afraid of fireworks is that fireworks 
make a loud, unexplainable noise, that dogs cannot escape. An unexpected
 firework will startle a human being. When something startles us, our 
body releases adrenaline, our heartbeat and pulse rate increase, and we 
instinctively feel defensive. Through our understanding, we can laugh 
the fear off because we know that fireworks won’t hurt us. A dog, 
however, doesn’t know what a firework is. So, as the noises continue, 
they become more and more afraid.</p>



<p>The loud noise triggers 
the dog’s flight or fight response, but the dog can do nothing to make 
the noise stop. Simply put it is normal for a dog to be afraid of loud 
noises such as fireworks. Your dog does not know what they are or where 
they are coming from. It is impossible to explain to them that there is 
no need to worry. So until they can become used to what triggers their 
anxiety they will always need care and reassurance in its presence.</p>



<p>The
 noise of a firework is very unnatural. It is very loud, and it comes 
without any warning. A dog’s hearing is much more sensitive than our 
own, so they startle much easier than we do. If your dog is nervous 
generally, fireworks could be terrifying for your pet.</p>



<h3>Past Experiences</h3>



<p>Sometimes there is a link between a dog’s fear of fireworks and a previous experience. If the dog has been maltreated, it may associate loud noises with the bad treatment. Perhaps a previous owner often yelled at the dog. This would explain why the dog gets tenses up when it hears loud noises. This is why it is never a good idea to yell at your dog for any reason. You do not want to form or intensify any negative reactions towards loud noises. Instead, rewarding your dog with positive reinforcement is always the best way to go.</p>



<h3>Genetically Predisposition</h3>



<p>There is also evidence that some breeds of dogs are more susceptible to fireworks anxiety than others. So, this fear could be an element of genetics as well. For instance, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, American Foxhounds, Beagles, and Pointers are some examples of hunting dogs. Hunting dog breeds were bred and raised around loud noises like gunshots and yelling. Because of their genetic history, these dog breeds may be less likely to have fireworks anxiety. However, It is common for any breed of dog to have a general fear of fireworks or loud noises.</p>

<h3>What Are the Symptoms of Dog Firework Anxiety?</h3>



<p>If your pet does have fireworks anxiety, the symptoms will be plain 
to see. They will vary in severity depending on how nervous your pet is,
 but it will be obvious if your pet is frightened by fireworks. 
Fireworks anxiety won’t cause any long-term issues for your dog, but it 
will be very distressing for your pet. This is the reason why so many 
people ask what I can give my dog for fireworks anxiety. The main 
symptoms of fireworks anxiety are:</p>



<ul><li>Seeking Comfort</li><li>Shaking</li><li>Trembling</li><li>Hiding</li><li>Salivation</li><li>Urination</li></ul>



<p>Most dogs that are experiencing fireworks anxiety will tremble and try to hide away behind furniture or under a table. If they are <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">very  frightened</g>, they may urinate, or run away. In some cases, dogs <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">become  destructive</g> when they feel anxiety. They may chew on furniture, or <g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="11" data-gr-id="11">claw  at</g> carpets.</p>

<h4>How to Calm My Dog with Cannabidiol?</h4>

<p>Recent research has suggested that CBD oil has many potential  medicinal uses for cats. It relieves pain, reduces anxiety, and has  powerful anti-inflammatory effects.</p>



<p>This has led to a growing market in cat CBD products. From CBD oil for cats to CBD infused cat treats,  there is no end to the variety of CBD products for cats. The question  that remains on many pet owners’ minds, though, is simple. Is CBD oil  safe for cats?</p>



<p>Marijuana has been found to be toxic if given to 
animals in high doses. CBD is a compound that is found in both legal 
industrial hemp and marijuana. So does that mean that CBD is not safe 
for cats?</p>



<p>If you have been thinking about using CBD for your cat, here are the real story and facts.</p>



<h3>What is CBD Oil?</h3>



<p>CBD is the common abbreviation for a compound known as cannabidiol. 
Cannabidiol is one of more than 113 active cannabinoids identified in 
the hemp plant.</p>



<p>Humans and most other animals have what is called an endocannabinoid system. This is a system of receptors that is stimulated by natural endocannabinoids in the body.</p>



<p>When stimulated, these receptors control things like pain, inflammation,  mood, and appetite. When cannabinoids like cannabidiol are introduced  to the body, they have the same effect. They also help to maintain the  body’s natural internal balance.</p>



<p>Benefits of CBD oil may include:</p>



<ul><li>Anti-inflammatory activity</li><li>Reducing chronic pain</li><li>Blocking cell growth (Cancer)</li><li>Preventing the growth of blood vessels that supply tumors</li><li>Anti-viral activity</li><li>Promoting strong joints &amp; mobility</li><li>Reducing seizure frequency &amp; muscle spasms</li><li>Reducing anxiety &amp; stress</li><li>Calming aggression</li><li>Relieving nausea &amp; digestive issues</li><li>Benefitting aging &amp; wellness</li></ul>



<p>CBD
 oil is a concentrated extract made from hemp plants. It is made by 
passing a solvent over the plant. It’s a bit like making tea from tea 
leaves.</p>



<p>Full-spectrum CBD oil contains high levels of CBD, but very low levels THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol).</p>



<p>THC  is another cannabinoid that causes the “high” feeling. CBD, on the other hand, is safe for all pets and non-psychoactive so it does NOT  cause the “high” feeling.</p>



<h4>Hemp vs. Marijuana</h4>



<p>Hemp and marijuana plants belong to the same family of plants 
(cannabis). That has led to a lot of confusion over the safety of hemp 
products. Even though both plants belong to the same family, the 
chemical makeup of the two plants is very different.</p>



<p>The most 
important difference between the two plants is the amount of THC that 
each contains. Medical marijuana contains around 5-20% THC. Some strains
 can contain as much as 30%.</p>



<p>Hemp, on the other hand, only contains around 0.3% THC at the most. The THC content of hemp is so low that you could not possibly consume enough to feel any psychoactive symptoms <strong>(HEMP = ZERO HIGH)</strong>.</p>



<p>This is another reason why many countries have now legalized hemp CBD products, but not marijuana-derived products. CBD derived from hemp is not psychoactive.  It is safe, not toxic and considered safe for pets.</p>

There are no known <strong>negative side effects</strong>.</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>CBD: Same Health Benefits but Without the High</h4>



<p>The health benefits of medical marijuana have been known for 
centuries. So, having answered the question of; is CBD oil safe for 
cats, you might ask, does CBD oil have the same medicinal benefits as 
marijuana?</p>



<p>Scientists have only begun to understand why cannabis  has so many therapeutic effects. One thing they have discovered is that  CBD has the same beneficial effects as cannabis. In fact, it has now been discovered that CBD counteracts the psychoactive effects of THC.</p>



<p>When CBD interacts with the endocannabinoid system, it helps to regulate the natural balance of the body. This is known as homeostasis.  Studies have shown that this effect of CBD has wide-ranging therapeutic  benefits. CBD has been proven to control seizures, reduce anxiety,  relieve pain, and much more. </p>



<p>Research
 into the use of CBD in medicine is still ongoing. It is known that CBD 
is safe for cats, humans and other pets. The full extent of the 
potential uses of CBD, though, is still in the process of being 
uncovered.</p>



<h4>So… Is CBD Oil Safe for My Cat?</h4>



<p>Cats are very picky eaters and for a good reason. They are very 
sensitive to many things. Marijuana can be toxic to cats. CBD oil, 
though, <strong>is considered SAFE for cats</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One
 thing to be aware of when buying CBD oil for cats is that CBD products 
are not currently regulated by the FDA. It is important that you 
research CBD products before you give them to your cat.</p>



<p>Hemp-derived
 CBD products that contain 0.3% THC or less will not make your cat high.
 Cannabis-derived products with higher levels of THC, though, might.</p>



<p>There
 are lots of different types of CBD products on the market. CBD oil can 
vary a lot in quality. Look for lab test results. Do not always go for 
the cheapest option, it may contain harmful additives.</p>



<p>CBD oil is known to be non-toxic. There are no known <strong>negative side effects</strong>.</p>



<p>There have never been any reports of any cats ever having overdosed on CBD oil.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>How Much CBD Should I Give My Cat?</h4>



<p>Because CBD oil is not regulated by the FDA or veterinarian bodies, there are no official dosage guidelines.</p>



<p>The dose of CBD you give to your cat will depend on the amount of CBD concentration in the product and the weight of your cat</p>



<ul><li>We generally recommend between 0.25 mg (a Regular Dose) to 0.5 mg (a Strong Dose) of CBD per every 1 lb of bodyweight.</li></ul>



<p>As
 there is no known toxic level of CBD oil. Your cat can never overdose 
on CBD. However, there is no benefit to be gained from giving your cat 
more CBD oil than it needs. Very high qualities of CBD may make your cat
 drowsy.</p>



<p>The best CBD products for cats  will come with proper dosage guidelines. Otherwise, your vet should be  able to give you some guidance. If your cat is already being given other  medications, you should check with your vet before giving your pet CBD  oil.</p>



<p>Always&nbsp;start with the lowest recommended dose, monitor your results, and then adjust the dosage as required.</p>
